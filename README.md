![packaged app preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ae73c6-e5ba-46e6-8224-8b3e92e26b27)

1. Ensure `.env` has all the values as `.env` file gets packaged with the application.
2. Run `yarn build`. It builds the app only using `target: dir` on Mac. Use `target: dmg` to build dmg.
3. Check `dist` folder for the app.
